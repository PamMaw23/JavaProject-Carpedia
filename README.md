This is a full stack application in Java (featuring Google Maps, Bootstrap, CSS and Javascript), created using Spring Suite Tools 
serving a luxury car dealership by allowing them to display the vehicles in their showroom and also schedule vehicle service 
appointments for their clients. The application was inspired by my son who loves everything about cars but finds luxury cars 
particularly fascinating.
